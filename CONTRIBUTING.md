### Git usage

This project follows [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) loosely.
In addition, you should name your branch like `<name>/feature-x`

Example commits:

- `feat: profile support`
- `fix(db): insert query`

### Notes for the server

- Requires Postgres to be running.
- If you have docker available you can `docker build . -t airshipper` and `docker-compose up` to make the server available. However make sure to checkout [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) to verify your setup is correct.

### Notes on testing

- use the `test_all.ps1` script to run all tests.
- If you run linux feel free to contribute linux equivalent scripts.
